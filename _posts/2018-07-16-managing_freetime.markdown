Scheduling and managing free time is an incredibly important piece to accomplishing a goal. In the context of the developer program, free time might equate to knowing when you need to take a break. Everyone hits a point of information overload, where they are no longer learning but simply pushing through. Sometimes, the solution might be to take a day off from your regular learning routine, other times, you might need more than just one day. While I have definitely practiced the former, I recently also took an extended break... maybe 10 days or so while on vacation. The long time off was amazing and refreshing.

Timing is super important. For me, I had just completed the CLI project, so looking ahead to the next section, this seemed like a great opportunity. Starting back up with SQL provided somewhat of a soft landing. SQL commands are very literal -- create, select, join, insert, etc... The basic lessons and labs helped me to get back into a routine without too much stress. And by the time I had hit the ORM section, I was fully back in the swing of things. The ORM section ties back in the Object Oriented concepts and reinforces the cumulative structure of the program, before moving onto new topics such as Active Record and Rack.

The key takeaway here is to plan ahead. Don't be afraid to look forward in the curriculum to see what the next topics are, or when the next project begins. Maintaining a solid routine and picking spots for downtime are necessary components to the successful completion of any project.
